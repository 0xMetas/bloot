# Synthetic Loot Botting

Sample script demonstrating mass generation of Ethereum addresses, for Synthetic Loot, to find Divine Robes (customizeable).

I recommend using a forknet to speed up processing. Outputs private keys with Divine Robes to `divine-robe-wallets.txt`.

## Run locally

```bash
# Install dependencies (in root folder)
npm install

# Start botting
node index.js
```
