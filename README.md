# About

This repository contains tooling and data for [Bloot](https://opensea.io/collection/blootofficial) and other derivative projects, and is free to use without credit or attribution, for any means.

I don't really know how to explain bloot itself. Good luck.

## Distribution

- tokenIds `1` to `8008` claimable by user.
- Each token has attributes: `chest`, `foot`, `hand`, `head`, `neck`, `ring`, `waist`, `weapon`.

## Output

- `output/bloot.json` contains all tokenIds and their attributes.
- `output/occurrences.json` contains the number of occurrences by attribute.
- `output/rare.json` contains a mapping of `blootId` to `score` (which is the sum of number of occurrences of each child attribute for a `blootId`), sorted ascending by `score`. It also includes `rarest` which is how rare the loot bags attributes are (`1` == `rarest`, `8008` == `least rare`), based on this specific ranking mechanism.
- `output/probability.json` contains a mapping of `blootId` to `rank` by probabilistic occurrence rather than rank (`P(A in bag at slot 1)` and `P(B in bag at slot 2)`, then `P(A in slot 1 and B in slot 2)` is the product of the 2 probabilities).
- `output/images.json` contains the base64 encoded SVG of each tokenId
